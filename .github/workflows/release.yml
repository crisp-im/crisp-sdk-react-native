# Release Workflow
#
# Purpose: Automates versioning and NPM publishing using Changesets.
#
# How it works (two-phase process):
#
#   Phase 1 - When changesets exist (.changeset/*.md files):
#     → Creates a "Version Packages" PR that:
#       - Bumps version in package.json
#       - Updates CHANGELOG.md
#       - Removes consumed changeset files
#
#   Phase 2 - When "Version Packages" PR is merged:
#     → Runs `yarn release` which:
#       - Builds the SDK
#       - Publishes to NPM
#       - Creates a Git tag (e.g., v0.2.0)
#
# Trigger: Every push to the master branch
#
# Required secrets:
#   - GITHUB_TOKEN: Auto-provided by GitHub (for creating PRs)
#   - NPM_TOKEN: Must be configured manually (for publishing to NPM)
#
# Setup NPM_TOKEN:
#   1. Create token at https://www.npmjs.com/settings/[username]/tokens
#   2. Add to repo: Settings → Secrets → Actions → New repository secret
