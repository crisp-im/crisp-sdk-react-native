# Build & Lint Workflow
#
# Purpose: Validates that the SDK compiles and passes linting on every PR.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Compiles TypeScript (src/ → build/)
#   2. Runs ESLint to check code quality
#   3. Verifies Biome formatting
#
# What it does NOT do:
#   - Does NOT build native code (iOS/Android)
#   - Does NOT build the example app
#   - Does NOT run tests
#
# Trigger: Every pull request targeting the master branch
#
# Duration: ~1 minute
#
# Required secrets: None
